Following data path components

a) ALU control logic
b) 32-bit 128 location Data Memory
c) 5-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer

Design the simple data path figure 4.17
 - PC, instruction memory, and PC update circuitry is ot necessary


Control path must support
  - add, sub, and, or, lw, sw

  R format instructions example
  Op code = 0
  RegDst = 0
  RegWrite = during the WB stage
  ALUSrc = 0
  ALU Op = 10
  MemRead = 0
  MemWrite = 0
  MemToReg = 0




need 3 muxes
  5bit 2to1 muxes

can set up control
6 bit opcode controls the control path




Control Path
takes an opcode sets based on code
